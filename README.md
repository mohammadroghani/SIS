# SIS

In this repository, we implement sequential importance sampling for estimating expectations over the space of perfect matchings using the algorithm in X. Moreover, we implement two applications of estimating the number of perfect matchings, counting Latin rectangles, and card guessing with yes/no feedback.

Also, we implement the greedy strategy for the card guessing in polynomial time using dynamic programming.
